##Rails Day 1 Lab

Pair exercise. 1 Hour.

Create a Rails app for a resource of your choice with the RESTful routes.

You'll need to create a model and controller for your chosen data. Make sure you test your models. 

Your app should also have two routes for Index and Show. 

No scaffolding.

Use JSON and Insomnia to test your API.
