## Refactoring to ES6 Lab

We're going to practice the es6 syntax by taking another look at the Music Charts App and refactoring the code to use es6.

You can use your own version that you completed, or if you prefer, or if your version isn't working / complete, you can start from our es5 extended homework end point.

Time: ~ 1 hour
